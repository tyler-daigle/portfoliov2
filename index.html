      <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
      <p>These are just some of the projects that I am currently working on.</p>

            I created a website to help people practice for the amateur radio exams. The website allows you to practice
            for all three classes of exams: Technician, General and Amateur Extra.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project was created with React. The question data is hosted on <strong>Contentful</strong> and the
            client side is hosted on <strong>Netlify</strong>. It allows a user to take an exam and then see their
            results at the end.
          </p>

            I wanted to create a better way for a campsite to take reservations. I made an interactive
            form that will display available campsites based on the type of site the user chooses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began the process by designing the site in <strong>Figma</strong>. The site was created
            with <strong>NextJS</strong> and hosted on <strong>Netlify</strong>.
